"""
A Python set is an unordered data structure where the
elements cannot appear twice.
Hashability makes an object valid as a member of a set.
All of Pythonâ€™s immutable built-in objects are hashable
and call the function hash().
Objects which are instances of user-defined classes are
hashable by default because they all compare unequal and
their hash value is their id()
